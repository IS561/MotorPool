## IS561 Group 2: Assignment 1 File 2 (Rationale)

For this assignment, our decision is based on the main goal of the system stated in the assignment instructions: keeping track of vehicles borrowed from the University of Kentucky motor pool. We try to achieve completeness and make our choices of entity classes cover the information system as comprehensive as possible.  In the meanwhile, we guarantee the connectivity of the system and join each part together by carefully choosing the relationships that reflect exactly the most vital paths between components. These two principles drive us to capture the key points for the system’s success.

***

During the process of choosing 20 entity classes and relationships, we as a team shared some common thoughts, and we also had some controversies regarding the choice of entity scope as well as domains and codomains of a few relationships. The first example is about the entity class Driver. We had two major categories of Drivers, Employees of the University of Kentucky and Non-employees of the University of Kentucky, and both the Drivers essentially have the same attributes except the fact that the Employee Driver has a WorkID. We needed to combine the Drivers to make room for the Department Administrator. So we came up with a solution to combine the two driver entities into a single entity named Driver. This entity will have exactly the same attributes as the Employee Driver, only, in this case, the WorkID for the Non-employee Drivers will have a NULL value.

Our team also had a controversy over the entity named “driver information agency”. Originally, we had an entity named “Sonic e-Learning Inc”, which is an agency that records driver information and provides it to the university for the purpose of background investigation before lending vehicles. During the discussion, some teammates believed that this entity class was too specific for the system since it is possible for the university to change the contractor which provides such services. Therefore, we agreed to change the entity class to a more general one, which is a driver information agency.

Vehicle plays an important part in this system in a way that it connect many other entities. Moreover, according to the assignment instruction, vehicle information needs to be tracked carefully in the system. However, as one of the crucial entity of the whole system, the vehicle is comprised of various types: it can be either university-owned or personal, and among the personal vehicles, it can be either owned or rented. This complex structure made us struggle on choosing the right scope of the vehicle entity. Some teammates argued that we should have a vehicle entity that includes all types stated above, and some of us thought that. After reading the instructions, we agreed that only university-owned vehicles should be included in the system since it only aims to track “vehicles borrowed from the University of Kentucky motor pool”.

By the time the discussion reached the Department Administrator (DA), we already had 20 entities and relationships in total. In spite of that, everyone agreed to the fact that the DA plays an important role in the functioning of the system. Because of this fact, we had to make sure we combine two other entities/relationships into one or delete one entity/relationship. We combined the Employee Driver and Non-employee Driver into one entity called Driver  and made room to include an entity for the DA. The DA plays a set of major roles: DA is responsible for approving the expenditure from departmental funds, which is necessary for any activity in the Department including activities related to vehicles. The DA is also responsible for approving employees who need to drive UK-owned vehicles for the purpose of work associated with the University. In case somebody who is not an employee of the University requires to drive a University vehicle, the DA needs to provide express permission to approve this non-employee to drive a University vehicle. When discussing about relationships of the DA entity, Mihir raised that the DA takes many responsibilities including approving vehicle-borrowing requests as well as departmental funds. However, since DA’s other responsibilities are not tightly related with the system’s main functions, we decided to not include them in the relationships.

As long as there is a use of vehicles, accidents might occur and lead to damages of vehicles and injuries of people. In this case, insurance is brought to the front as a means of protection from financial loss, thus being essential to the vehicle information system. Regular information such as policies, driver etc. are the attributes of it. Originally, we had an entity class named “University of Kentucky's Motor Vehicle Insurance”, but we decided to exclude the specific institution name from the title and make it an attribute instead, because an entity class is an abstract concept and should not contain just one specific instance. In this case, a typical instance in the class is the University of Kentucky's Motor Vehicle Insurance.

***

Claim stands out in so many entity classes related to the motor vehicle insurance because it contains the formal demand of payment, which is the vital part of insurance. It’s obvious that vehicle accident report (VAR) is tightly connected with the whole procedure of implementing the insurance as the base for the final decision about compensation. However, no company will voluntarily start to process an accident, which means the claim is necessary serving as a start of all the procedures. Attributes of it such as the amount of payment will become the main reference for the actual payment. It provides a complete view for the insurance part of the system. And by the relationship “covers” between claim and accident which involves other information like a driver, we connect the insurance part to the other part of the system.

The whole process of completing this assignment as a group is an impressive and precious experience. This experience not only involves a full progress of learning and applying the learnt knowledge, but also requires us to make rational decisions on choice of entities and relationships based on assignment requirements. Moreover, we really enjoy discussing with each other and sharing our thoughts, and during this process, we have also clarified certain misunderstandings on some terminologies. Last but not the least, this experience trains our ability to plan tasks effectively as well as our collaborative skills to complete different tasks parallely and in high-quality.
