For the assignment 3, we worked together in two team meetings to finish the five deliverables.
In the first meeting our team met on campus and the second meeting was conducted on-line. To begin with the assignment, first we started to re-examine the assignment outlines. For that we read through all the documents of Group-2's to pick up a diagram on the framework purposes and elements that are included. Next, we audited the UML chart and RDF graph of Group 2 to comprehend their translation of the situation. 

The policy that has been taken into consideration is as follows.
A person employed by the University may be permitted to drive a University-owned, personal or rental vehicle when traveling 
on University business when the certain guidelines have been met like approval Department administrator, possession of a 
valid operator’s license and submission of an MVR Release Form to Risk Management by the driver and also the driver must have a minimum of five years driving experience. The driver also must not have health problems that limit or restrict his licensing. 
The driver must be involved in no more than two at-fault accidents in the past three years. MVR’s that have six or more deficiency points, as determined by the State Motor Vehicle Records, will result in the review of driving privileges.

As per assignment instruction, we made changes on the UML outline based on our comprehension, and we included essential entity classes and comparing connections to more readily mirror the inductions referenced in the task. At last, we draw the RDF chart dependent on the changed UML graph, and we wrote our Datalog code to test our presumptions on the inductions until the results that were obtained correctly reflected our expectations.

As depicted in the above diagrams, Insurance doesn't cover UK-own vehicles for the driver, it is covered for the university. Risk Management doesn't verify the MVR release form, it verifies the MVR. Admin. does not approve MVR release form, admin. approves the business activity. 

As we described in the beginning, we refined the model and the charts reciprocally amid the procedure. In this way, we didn't experience numerous issues that are explicitly identified with illustration outlines.

Subsequent to completing this task, our team has picked up a more profound comprehension of this framework. We understood that we ought to alter the model so it can all the more likely fit the framework prerequisites. Most importantly, when completing this examination, we not just have encouraged our comprehension of the whole framework yet, in addition, have rehearsed our graph drawing aptitudes, which influence us to understand the significance of the job these charts plays in envisioning the framework all in all.
