# Rationale for Group 2 Assignment 3
Based on the explanation in class and our understanding, we decided to focus on modifying the previous group's work in a way that would best suit its implementation in Datalog programming.
### Focus on Award and Category
The first step we took in this approach was to narrow down the scope of our analysis only on the category and award. We have removed certain objects like Guidelines, admin office and employee blocks lying between the award application and awards, as when we referred back to the document, we concluded that the award application is processed by the official which consists of dean and provosts who approves (based on the award amount) and the award is granted to the student completing the loop.
### Amount and category as objects
Another important aspect we covered was making amount and category as a separate object as this would help us deal with implementing in the code.

### Awards as an object
We also discussed about how we have made Awards as an object as opposed to our previous approach of categorizing something like that into an attribute. This we did again owing to the current requirement of implementing this is the code

### Group Work
Overall as a group we first brainstormed about how we could modify the previous work for this scenario, we discussed as what would be more appropriate and came up with conclusions that was agreed upon after convincing justification by the proposer of the idea. We came up with the schema level instance diagram, we split the coding into 3 parts where first part would contain Domains, codomains, and inverse relationships, second part would be to code the Instance graph assertions and finally the Rules of inference part.
