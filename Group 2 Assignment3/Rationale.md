# Rationale for Group 2 Assignment 3
For this assignment, our group worked together to complete the five deliverables. Firstly, before starting to revise its diagrams, we read through the supporting documents of group five to gain an overview on the system purposes and entities that are involved. Next, we reviewed the UML diagram and RDF diagram of group five to understand their interpretation of the scenario. Then, when revising the UML diagram, we decided to focus on modifying the group five's work in a way that would best suit its implementation in Datalog programming. According to professor's assignment instructions, we made changes on the UML diagram based on our understanding, and we added necessary entity classes and corresponding relationships to better reflect the inferences mentioned in the instructions. Finally, we draw the RDF diagram based on the revised UML diagram, and we wrote Datalog code to test our assumptions on the inferences until we got satisfying results.

### Focus on Award and Category
We had some discussions when revising the UML diagram of group five. The first step we took in this approach was to narrow down the scope of our analysis only on the entities relative to the process of giving an award. Therefore, we have put less focus on certain entity classes like Guideline, Admin Office and PRD that are about processing documents after awarding and assessing its validity. When we referred back to the document, we concluded that the process that is the most relevant to our assignment is the university officials (in this case, the provost and the dean) approve an award application filed by a department, then give the award to the student of the department completing the loop. Moreover, since our assignment is about adding necessary entities and relationships about determing if an award is category two, we decided to redesign the entity classes Award and Official and put more details on them.
### Amount and category as objects
Another important aspect we covered was making amount and category as a separate object as this would help us deal with implementing in the code.
### Awards as an object
We also discussed about how we have made Awards as an object as opposed to our previous approach of categorizing something like that into an attribute. This we did again owing to the current requirement of implementing this is the code

### Group Work
Overall as a group we first brainstormed about how we could modify the previous work for this scenario, we discussed as what would be more appropriate and came up with conclusions that were agreed upon after convincing justification by the proposer of the idea. We came up with the schema level instance diagram, we split the coding into 3 parts where first part would contain Domains, codomains, and inverse relationships, the second part would be to code the Instance graph assertions and finally the Rules of inference part.
