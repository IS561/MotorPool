GROUP 3 RATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION
Group Assignment 4 involved inference using owl. This was our task – 
Group 3: When the reasoner is active for your file, we'll see that:
•	bizactivity1 is insuredfor employeeA (because it's approved by A's supervisor)
•	bizactivity1 is an 'Insured Activity' because it's been approved by the supervisor of an employee who filled out an MVR.
•	In addition, confirm that Group 2's definitions make bizactivity1's designated driver employeeA (via the inverse).
We had to use Protégé to run the Motorpool3.owl file that was provided by the Professor. We started with the owl file. We followed part of this UML diagram to understand what needs to be done as part of the assignment. We concentrated on the highlighted classes and relationships for this assignment.
