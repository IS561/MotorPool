# Rationale for Group 2 Assignment 2

After reading the comments professor and fellow classmates gave us, we realized that there are many things we missed to consider and there are unimportant details we considered into this model while we shouldn’t.

Thus, based on the comment given by professor and fellow classmates also the advice given by TA, we made several changes to refine our motor pool model to better modeling the system for monitoring how well the "Using Vehicles" policies are respected at the University of Kentucky.

After our discussion, we made 5 major decisions about how to refine our model.

**The first is to combine entity classes which clearly can be described as one entity into one entity class.** With the help of fellow peers and professors’ comments, we notice that ‘Van Driver’, ‘Training Result’ are not necessary to two stand-alone classed. They can all be concluded into one entity class, ‘Driver’. The class ‘Van Driver’ does not have essential differences with the class ‘Driver’, except the fact that van drivers need to take a safety training course and pass the test, meaning it involves the Training Result entity class. This fact can be easily represented by an attribute about driver type and an attribute about passing the test or not. Therefore, we decided to remove these two classes and add these two as two attributes instead.

**The second is to add important or deleting unnecessary attributes which we forgot to take into consider the first time we built the model.** Since there is no identifier attribute for almost all entity, we give each attribute one ID to distinguish instances in themselves which is really important when building relationship among those entity when we need to take instances into consideration. Also, when we first made our model, we failed to give specific attribute which can help give more information about accident which led to many missing information of this entity class. Therefore, we added more specific information like diver’s info and accident happened time, location, etc. into this entity class. For entity class ‘Insurance’, we made the same mistake which led to many people fail to understand our intent which is that this is an entity class about general information of insurance, not specific ones. Thus, attributes for specific information are removed and for constitution of a general insurance were added. As for entity class "Department Administritor",considering there can be administrators with each belonging to one department, we add employee ID and department ID as attributes because none of the employees belongs to admonition department.

**The third is to remove unnecessary entity classed and to change the way of expressing some of the entity class to avoid misunderstanding.** Taking the suggestion given by one fellow classmates, we add the full name so other people won't get confused about what UK means. We also remove entity class "Administration Department" and "Driver Information Agency" due to the fact that these two only have relationship between themselves but contribute little to the entire system to keeps track of vehicles borrowed from the University of Kentucky motor pool.

**The fourth is to update existing relationships’ domain, codomain, arity or cardinality.** After taking professor and fellow classmates’ advice into serious consideration, we add scope to each relationship which we fail to do the first time.  For relationship ‘Approves’, we think what admin directly copes with is MVR, not driver. As one fellow has mentioned the ‘Covers’ relationship should be about accidents, we double checked all information files and confirmed our initial answer which is that the insurance covers vehicles thus we didn’t take this advice. But it gives us an opportunity to go through all the documents again, giving us a chance to get a fresh eye from the old documents.

**The fifth is to delete some unnecessary relationships and create some necessary relationships.** We removed ‘Shares’ from relationship and its domain and codomain from entity class due to its unclarity and it can be replaced. We create relationship “Fills out”, “Verifies” and “Approves” to replace ‘Shares’ relationship. In assignment 1, we failed to capture some important relationships among the entity classes that can help form a clear view on the whole system. During discussion, we noticed that we did not have a flowing relationship chain of what will happen after an accident involving a UK-owned vehicle during the process of carrying out university business. This is a major part in the whole system that involves many entities which requires us to fix. We revised the motor pool documents and finalized the steps to be followed after an accident, and we have created relationships based on the steps. Also, we create “Possess” relationship because this is the most important step to get compensation via insurance is that VAR and insurance claim together being processed by admin. For each accident, there's one VAR and one claim as request of compensation filed by driver to serve as reference of insurance processing final result. 

After conducting this analysis, our group has a deeper understanding of this system. By eliminating some attributes and entity classes as well as relationships, we have a clearer mind of why these attributes and entity classes as well as relationships don’t have much contribution to the entire system while at first glance they seemed to have. By adding and creating new attributes and entity classes as well as relationships, we now have understood the system more by figuring out what are actually contribute to the system. Above all, when finishing this analysis, we not only further our understanding of the entire system, but also practice our graph drawing which make us realize it is more clearer than expressing in words however we couldn’t have done that if we fail to grasp the whole picture of this system which is what the part of word expressing of this analysis gives us.
