# Rationale for Group 2 Assignment 2

After reading the comments professor and fellow classmates gave us, we realized that there were some things that we missed and there are trivial details we considered when making the model.

Thus, based on the comments made by professor and fellow classmates, along with the TA's advice, we made several changes to refine our motor pool model to better modeling the system for monitoring how well the "Using Vehicles" policies are respected at the University of Kentucky.

After our discussion, we made 5 major decisions about how to refine our model.

**The first is to combine entity classes which clearly can be described as one entity into one entity class.** With the guidance of classmates' and professor's comments, we noticed that the ‘Van Driver’ and ‘Driver’ are not necessarily two stand-alone classes. They can all be combined to form one entity class: ‘Driver’. The class ‘Van Driver’ is not significantly different than the ‘Driver’ class, except the fact that van drivers need to take a safety training course and pass the test; meaning, it involves the 'Training Result' entity class. This fact can be easily represented by an attribute about driver type and an attribute about passing the test or not. Therefore, we decided to remove these two entity classes and add them as two attributes to the 'Driver' class instead.

**The second is to add important or deleting unnecessary attributes which we forgot to take into consider the first time we built the model.** Since there were no identifier attributes for almost all entities, we made sure that we added a unique identifier attribute (called PRIMARY KEY in Database Terminology) for every single entity class to distinguish instances under the same class. This is really important when building relationship among those entities as we need to take instances into consideration. Also, when we first made our model, we did not give specific attribute which can help give more information about accident which led to a lot of missing information in this entity class. Therefore, we added more specific information like 'Driver’s Info' and 'Accident Time', 'Location', etc. to this entity class. For entity class ‘Insurance’, we made the same mistake which led to many people finding difficulty in understanding our intent to show that this entity class is about general insurance information, and not of specific instances. Thus, attributes for specific information are removed and for constitution of a general insurance were added. As for the "Department Administritor" entity class, considering there can be administrators with each belonging to one department, we add employee ID and department ID as attributes because none of the employees belongs to admonition department.

**The third is to remove unnecessary entity classes and to change the way of expressing some of the entity class to avoid confusion.** Taking into account the suggestion of a fellow classmate, we added the full name so other people won't get confused about what 'UK' means. We also removed the entity class "Administration Department" and "Driver Information Agency" due to the fact that these two only have relationship among themselves but contribute very little to the entire system that has the aim to keep track of vehicles borrowed from the University of Kentucky motor pool.

**The fourth is to update existing relationships’ domain, codomain, arity or cardinality.** After taking professor and fellow classmates’ advice into serious consideration, we added scope to each relationship which we did not do the first time.  For the ‘Approves’ relationship, we think what the Department Administrator directly copes with is MVR, not driver. As one classmte has mentioned, the ‘Covers’ relationship should be about accidents, we double checked all information files and confirmed our initial answer which is that the 'Insurance' covers 'Vehicles' thus we didn’t take this advice. But it gives us an opportunity to go through all the documents again, giving us a chance to get a fresh eye from the old documents.

**The fifth is to delete some unnecessary relationships and create some necessary relationships.** We removed ‘Shares’ from relationship and its domain and codomain from entity class due to its obscurity and it can be replaced. We created relationships 'Fills out', 'Verifies' and 'Approves' to replace ‘Shares’ relationship. In assignment 1, we did not to capture some important relationships among the entity classes that can help form a clear view on the whole system. During discussion, we noticed that we did not have a flowing relationship chain of what will happen after an accident involving a UK-owned vehicle during the process of carrying out university business. This is a major part in the whole system that involves many entities that require fixing. We revised the motor pool documents and finalized the steps to be followed after an accident, and we have created relationships based on these steps. Also, we created the 'Possess' relationship because the most important step to get compensation via insurance is that VAR and insurance claim are processed together by admin. For each accident, there's one VAR and one claim as request of compensation filed by driver to serve as reference of insurance processing final result. 

After conducting this analysis, our group has a deeper understanding of this system. By eliminating some attributes and entity classes as well as relationships, we have a clearer understanding of why these attributes and entity classes, as well as relationships don’t have much contribution to the entire system, while at first glance they seemed to. By adding and creating new attributes and entity classes as well as relationships, we now have understood the system better by figuring out which of these actually contribute to the system. Above all, when finishing this analysis, we not only further our understanding of the entire system, but also practice our graph drawing which made us realize the importance of the role these diagrams play in visualizing the system as a whole. However, we couldn’t have done that if we had failed to grasp the whole picture of this system, which is where the documentation of the previous assignment and all our classmates' and professor's suggestions come into picture.
