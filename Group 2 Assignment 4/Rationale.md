For this group assignment, we are required to use Protege to run the .owl file that professor provides to us and add more details to it to allow the reasoner to deduce the results stated in the assignment instruction. In this document, we will talk about the rational and justification of our group decisions, followed by our communication with the other two groups, finally the groupwork we have done for this assignment.
### Rationale and justification for group decisions ###
Before working on the three questions that we are assigned to, we made some preparations for them. Firstly, we created seven classes, one for each individual. However, according to professor's instructions, we did not directly link individuals to their corresponding class, since the reasoner should do the work. Next, since professor Dubin has provided properties, their inverse properties and some relationships between individuals, we were able to use the information to deduce domain and codomain of most properties. Therefore, we added domains and codomains of the properties as well as their inverse properties to prepare for solving the questions.  
Our first task is to let the reasoner deduce that employeeA is the *driverfor* bizactivity1 since we assume that there's only one traveler who's driving. In the original .owl file, properties (*travelson* and its inverse property *hastraveler*) between the class **Employee** and the class **Activity** do not provide enough information for our inference, therefore, we need a third party's help to add more inputs. According to the instructions, we needed to take the assumption that there is one traveler who is driving into consideration, and vehicle1 that has the class type **Vehicle** is an important individual in this assumption. Therefore, we tried to find relationships between classes **Employee**, **Activity** and **Vehicle**. From professorâ€™s code, we have: employeeA *travelson* bizactivity1, and bizactivity1 *usesvehicle* vehicle1. Since **Employee** and **Activity** are domain and codomain of the property *drives*, from this we know: employeeA *drives* vehicle1. Now we have our first inference, which is under *drives* property:  
**_owl:propertyChainAxiom( :travelson :usesvehicle)_**

After this, we ran our reasoner and it showed employeeA *drives* vehicle1, which is actually the result of our second task: employeeA drives vehicle1 since he drove for an activity that used the car. We got this result before getting that of the first task purely by accident.  
  
After this, we wanted to relate this result to the property *driverfor*. We know that employeeA *drives* vehicle1, and vehicle1 *usedinactivity* bizactivity1. Moreover, **Employee** and **Activity** are the domain and codomain of property *driverfor*. Therefore, we have our second (and the last) inference for this task, which is under the *driverfor* property:  
**_owl:propertyChainAxiom( :drives :usedinactivity)_**

After running the reasoner, we were able to see both results that are required in our assignment task 1 and task 2. The lask task requires us to add a rule of inference so that employeeA *reports* accidentreport1 because it documents an accident involving him.
