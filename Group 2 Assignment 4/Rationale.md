For this group assignment, we are required to use Protege to run the MortorPool3.owl file that professor provides to us and add more details to it to allow the reasoner to deduce the results stated in the assignment instruction. In this document, we will talk about the rational and justification of our group decisions, followed by our communication with the other two groups, finally the groupwork we have done for this assignment.
### Rationale and justification for group decisions ###
Before working on the three questions that we are assigned to, we made some preparations for them. Firstly, we created seven classes, one for each individual. However, according to professor's instructions, we did not directly link individuals to their corresponding class, since the reasoner should do the work. Next, since professor Dubin has provided properties, their inverse properties and some relationships between individuals, we were able to use the information to deduce domain and codomain of most properties. Therefore, we added domains and codomains of the properties as well as their inverse properties to prepare for solving the questions. Moreover, from what we have learnt in class, we know that when creating a property chain, the domain and codomain of two adjacent properties should be the same, and the domain of the first property as well as the codomain of the last property should be consistent with the aiming property.  

Our first task is to let the reasoner deduce that employeeA is the *driverfor* bizactivity1 since we assume that there's only one traveler who's driving. In the original MortorPool3.owl file, properties (*travelson* and its inverse property *hastraveler*) between the class **Employee** and the class **Activity** do not provide enough information for our inference, therefore, we need a third party's help to add more inputs. According to the instructions, we needed to take the assumption that there is one traveler who is driving into consideration, and vehicle1 that has the class type **Vehicle** is an important individual in this assumption. Therefore, we tried to find relationships between classes **Employee**, **Activity** and **Vehicle**. From professorâ€™s code, we have: employeeA *travelson* bizactivity1, and bizactivity1 *usesvehicle* vehicle1. Since **Employee** and **Activity** are domain and codomain of the property *drives*, from this we know: employeeA *drives* vehicle1. Now we have our first inference, which is under *drives* property:  
**_owl:propertyChainAxiom( :travelson :usesvehicle)_**

After this, we ran our reasoner and it showed employeeA *drives* vehicle1, which is actually the result of our second task: employeeA drives vehicle1 since he drove for an activity that used the car. We got this result before getting that of the first task purely by accident.  
  
After this, we wanted to relate this result to the property *driverfor*. We know that employeeA *drives* vehicle1, and vehicle1 *usedinactivity* bizactivity1. Moreover, **Employee** and **Activity** are the domain and codomain of property *driverfor*. Therefore, we have our second (and the last) inference for this task, which is under the *driverfor* property:  
**_owl:propertyChainAxiom( :drives :usedinactivity)_**

After running the reasoner, we were able to see both results that are required in our assignment task 1 and task 2. The last task requires us to add a rule of inference so that employeeA *reports* accidentreport1 because it documents an accident involving him. When we were working on this task, we realized that there were many relationships can be used to form a property chain which leads to the property *reports*, but the reasoner was unable to generate desired results. Then we tried to use only the properties which involve individuals (in the individuals section of MotorPool3.owl, from line 152 to line 184) and are provided in the original MortorPool3.owl file as well as their inverse properties to form the property chain, and we finally got the result that is in line with our task. We think it is because our desired results include both properties and individuals, therefore properties that do not have individuals involved are unable to contribute to the inferencing process.  

Finally, we had a property chain that includes three properties: *travelson*, *included* and *documentedby*. *travelson* is directly indicated in MortorPool3.owl and the other two properties are inverse properties of *occurredduring* and *documents*, which also have individuals involved. The codomain and the domain of two adjacent properties (two pairs here: *travelson* and *included*, *included* and *documentedby*) are the same, and the domain of the first property (*travelson*) as well as the codomain of the last property (*documentedby*) are consistent with the aiming property (*reports*). Our inference for this task under the *reports* property is:
**_owl:propertyChainAxiom ( :travelson :included :documentedby)_**

We were able to see all results after running the reasoner.

### Communication with other groups ## 
The main focus for Group 3's task was to deal with the business activity. Now, it was crucial that their definition of the relationship  between an instance of business activity and an instance of an employee is aligned with ours, and there is no contradiction or ambiguity resulting due to inferences. Our owl file confirms that the business activity - bizactivity1 *designateddriver* employeeA. This relationship is formed as an inverse of the employeeA *driverof* bizactivity1 and hence aligns with Group 3's requirement. We also need to confirm from Group 5 whether their definition and inferences confirm that an employeeA and bizactivity1 has the relationship employeeA *isinsuredonactivity* bizactivity1. It is important that the employeeA is insured specifically on bizactivity1 for the insurance to be applicable.  

On the other hand, the main focus of Group 5's task was the accident itself. We need to make sure that a specific employee was driving when a specific accident occurred. This will record the employee's involvement in an accident and will as a result make the accident relevant to the system based around insurance. Even though this is the case, Group 5 only has a relationship travelson between employeeA and bizactivity1 whereas they must have an employeeA droveinaccident must be an inverse relationship of the accident1 involvesdriver employeeA as per their activity description.
